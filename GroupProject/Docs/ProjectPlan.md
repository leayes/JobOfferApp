## 1 Introduction

Our application is made to track and compare job opportunities including several facets of total compensation, cost of living by location and other offered benefits.

## 2 Process Description

- *Activity name (verb or verb phrase)*
- *Activity description (concise paragraph)*
- *Entrance criteria (inputs needed for the activity)*
- *Exit criteria (outputs produced by the activity and how you know it has been

Decomposing and assigning individual work tasks using a kanban-style ticketing system such as Jira, Trello, or the GitHub projects feature.
Ticketing is a standard procedure of professional software engineers, it allows engineers to group similar tasks together under larger milestones, delegate work among the group in the most efficient way and track progress towards the end goal such that project completion dates can be more accurately predicted.
Entrance criteria will be the project plan.
Exit criteria will be a set of tickets nested within epics (or milestones) that describe the work to be done in sufficient detail.

### UI Design, wireframing
Creating a user friendly interface that integrates the different functions of the app with the underlying data structures that store the information being added.
Entrance criteria will be the requirements for the app and the user initiated functions listed in Assignment 5.
Exit criteria will be a user interface that is includes all the app requirements

### App creation in Android Studio
Create the boilerplate application code in Android Studio by instantiating a new Android project.
Entrance criteria: no project has been instantiated.
Exit criteria: a project has been instantiated.

### Class Structures
Defining the class structures and their attributes and methods to store the data used by the app and defining the functions used to transfer information between classes.
Entrance criteria will be the classes listed in the UML Diagram
Exit criteria will be checking if each class and its attributes have been implemented

### Unit-Testing
Create a test-suite of unit tests to ensure the functionality of the individual functions which make up the application are creating the correct output given a test input. These tests should be deterministic and should not include testing UI elements or interacting with the UI.
An in-progress application with functions to test
A unit-test suite for a majority of the functions in the application (>50% code-coverage)
Entrance criteria are the requirements from assignment 5
Exit criteria is a test suite that adequately tests the requirements in such a way that are easily testable.

### Integration-Testing / Validation
Integration testing is the portion of tests that exercise the high-level objectives of the project via the UI and does not test individual functions. This should incorporate a list of user input (clicks or text) with expected output to ensure application stability during development.
A usable application
A play-book of user instructions for interacting with the application and the expected output of those interactions.

### User Feedback
This is the stage where the application is in a “beta” state and is ready to gather feedback from the community. Users will use the application and provide feedback on likes and dislikes which can shape future iterative development cycles.
A working application with some minimal end-to-end functionality
A set of user likes and dislikes with an action plan to address the dislikes.
